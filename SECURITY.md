# ICTU SonarQube Security Policy

## Current status

The ICTU SonarQube container image has not implemented any hardening, but relies on the upstream [SonarQube container image](https://github.com/SonarSource/docker-sonarqube/).
In order to stay up to date, monitor SonarQube security findings and update accordingly.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the ICTU SonarQube container image is currently being supported with security updates.
The intention is to keep the container image based on a recent SonarQube version, there is no incentive to patch older tags.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can privately [report a vulnerability issue in this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/ICTU/sonar/security/advisories/new).
The aim is to get back to you within 24 hours, with a confirmation of the issue and a brief action plan or a request for more information.
